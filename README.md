## Abstract

In this paper, we discuss the methodological procedures and the computation of the value of travel time saving and value of statistical life in road travels in Brazil. A stated preference experiment was carried out, in which we bring some innovations in order to control for hypothetical bias. The survey was conducted online through the snowball technique, requesting respondents to choose between two hypothetical routes with different levels of three attributes: toll cost, time and number of deaths. The mixed logit model was used to estimate the willingness to pay for the travel time saving and for the death risk reduction. The results show significant difference in the values given the certainty level in the individualÂ´s answer. The model is also estimated controlled for travel behavior and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite the important results found, the first ones in our knowledge for the Brazilian context, the data collection was biased which made it impossible to extrapolate the results to the population.
